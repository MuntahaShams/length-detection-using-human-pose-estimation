# length-detection-using-human-pose-estimation
This projec is able to detect length of amrs and shoulder to neck distance. I have used MPII dataset that is able to detect 15 keypoints of body 

## Testing

### C++ 
- Please use [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), now it can run in CPU/ GPU and windows /Ubuntu.
- Three input options: images, video

### Python
- `cd length-detection-using-human-pose-estimation/python`
- `ipython notebook`
- Open `OpenPose_Notebook.ipynb` and execute the code for image
- Open `video.ipynb` and execute the code for video
